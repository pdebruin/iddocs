# Authenticate

In authentication, a user or application proves they are who they say they are by providing valid credentials. The most common verification is password, often combined with other methods, such as a fingerprint.

IAM simplifies the use of open industry standards like OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and SAML to authenticate. Users can log into your applications with social media credentials, corporate accounts, and a broad range of other credentials.

## Add Login
Implement IAM Universal Login (or an alternative) to control access to your applications.

[Login]()

Choose from a variety of user login options.

[Single Sign-On]()

[Passwordless]()

Let users enter mobile phone numbers or email addresses and receive a one-time code or link to log in without a password.

## Provision Users
Source users from social identity providers (such as Facebook or SalesForce), enterprise user stores (such as Active Directory or Google Workspace), a custom database, and more.

[Enterprise Connections]()

Authenticate users with external, federated identity providers such as Azure AD, Google Workspace, and PingFederate.

[Protocols]()

Easily implement open industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0, SAML, and LDAP for authentication and authorization.

[Connection Settings Best Practices]()

Review best practices when configuring social and database connections.
