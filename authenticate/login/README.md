# Login

IAM offers two ways to implement login authentication for your applications:

* Universal Login where users log in to your application through a page hosted by IAM.
* Embedded Login where users log in to your application through a page you host.

For the vast majority of use cases, we recommend Universal Login. It's safe and easy to implement.
